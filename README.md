# MERN ECOMMERCE PETSHOP

An eCommerce web application created with the MERN stack + redux. 

## Installation
  node install\
  npm run dev -- runs both the front end and back end concurrently\
  npm run server -- runs just the back end\
  cd frontend npm start -- runs just the front end

## About the app
  The web app was created as a personal project ment to create an updated version of a local petshops website.
  The back end was created using Express and mongoDB, all data imports are written into the data folder on the back end. 
  The front end was created using bootstrap, react, redux and react-router. 
  
  **Update** 
  Current work being done is on updating the app to be reusable as a template for creating ecommerce stores. 
  Adding global settings that can be changed which determine which modules of the app are used on creation. Ex. An appointment module for stores requiring schedules.
